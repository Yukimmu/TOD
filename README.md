#  TOD Analysis Tool
## TOD Introduction
The full name of TOD is transit oriented development. It is an urban complex planning integrating commerce, culture, education and residence, which is established with a radius of 400-800 meters (about 5-10 minutes' walk) centered on public transport stations. Singapore Orchard Road complex, Tokyo Midtown, Hong Kong Kowloon Station and other world classic subway covered urban complexes belong to this kind.
## TOD Analysis Tool Introduction
TOD Analysis Tool is a tool to analyze the potential of TOD mode construction. On a small scale, it can find stations suitable for the development of TOD mode and the green system around each station. On a large scale, it can compare the development of TOD in different countries. Here is a picture of the Grasshopper Definition：

## Use Instruction
- Input the information of one city here

- Adjust the number bar to adjust the distance between the stations and each area. （Now it is set to “400m”）

- Add new stations to find suitable construction stations.

- You can adjust number bar to make potential display clear.

## Tool Function
- For Urban planners:
You can make TOD potential maps to show each station with TOD construction potential.
You also can use this tool to find new stations witch will be suitable for TOD construction.

- For landscape architects:
TOD neighborhoods typically feature a transit station and public spaces as well as a walkable street network connecting moderate- or high-density residential and commercial buildings to that station within a  half-mile radius.That means the green space system is also very important for the construction of TOD. When you zoom in, you can clearly see the green space system around each station, which can guide the landscape construction of TOD. You can also integrate void land or some abandoned infrastructures into the green system and think about landscape design around each station.

- For businesses:
You can make a better decision about the site of a store or land development.
For example, compared with pictures 1 and 2 below, the station in picture 1 is located in a larger white area and serves a larger number of people.  Businesses can choose the first picture site for commercial development because this site may attract more people and they can gain more profit.

## Graph Description
- The first graph shows the connection status of different land uses and stations.
- The second graph shows the percentage and number of different TOD potentials.

Tips： you can also change the style and color to make mapping more presentable！
